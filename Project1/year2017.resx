    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>PASSIVE: LIVING VENGEANCE = INNATE: When Varus kills an enemy, he gains 10 / 15 / 20% (based on level) (+ 20% bonus attack speed) bonus attack speed for 5 / 7 / 9 / 11 (based on level) seconds, increased to 40% (+ 40% bonus attack speed) upon scoring an enemy champion takedown.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label24.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R: CHAIN OF CORRUPTION = ACTIVE: Varus unleashes a tendril of corruption in the target direction that infects the first enemy champion hit, dealing magic damage and rooting them for 2 seconds, during which they are revealed. Over the first 1.5 seconds, they are also inflicted with maximum stacks of Blight. Upon impact, the tendril roots into the ground from which it seeks out nearby enemy champions. If a target does not leave the area within 2 seconds, they subsequently become infected as well, taking the same damage and effects. A new tendril is then spread out from the infected target that is closest to a nearby uninfected enemy champion. The infection can spread repeatedly until there are no new targets.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label25.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>E: HAIL OF ARROWS = ACTIVE: Varus fires a hail of arrows at the target location that land after 0.5 seconds, dealing physical damage to enemies hit. The area then becomes desecrated for 4 seconds, slowing enemies within and inflicting them with 25% Grievous Wounds.</value>

Against a champion or epic monster, this also reduces his basic abilities' current cooldowns by 12% of the total cooldown for each stack, up to 36% per target. This damage is capped at 360 against monsters. ACTIVE: Varus' next Piercing Arrow within 5.5 seconds is empowered to deal 6% − 14% (based on level) of the target's missing health bonus magic damage, increased by 0% − 50% (based on Piercing Arrow's channel time), for a maximum of 9% − 21% (based on level) of the target's missing health. This damage is capped at 360 against monsters. If Varus does not cast Piercing Arrow, Blighted Quiver can be recast after 1 second within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards or when he dies. Blighted Quiver can be cast during the first 0.25 seconds of Piercing Arrow's charge, and will be placed on full cooldown even if Piercing Arrow is not recast.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label39.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Q : PIERCING ARROW = ACTIVE: Varus charges while being slowed by 20% for up to 4 seconds to increase range and damage over the first 1.25 seconds of the channel.

RECAST: Varus fires a piercing arrow in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit. The damage of the arrow as well as any detonated Blight stacks are increased by 0% − 50% (based on channel time), and the arrow's damage is reduced by 0% − 67% (based on enemies hit).</value>

  <data name="label36.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>E : HELP, PIX! = ACTIVE: Lulu can cast Help, Pix! on herself or the target unit.

    <value>PASSIVE: PIX, FAERIE COMPANION = INNATE: Lulu is assisted by Pix, an untargetable faerie, who follows her around and fires a barrage of 3 bolts towards her target whenever she uses a basic attack on-attack. Each bolt deals 5 − 39 (based on level) (+ 5% AP) magic damage to the first enemy it collides with, for a total of 15 − 117 (based on level) (+ 15% AP) on hitting a single target with all three bolts. Casting Help, Pix! on an ally champion transfers Pix's help to them, causing him to fire the bolts dependent on their basic attacks. Pix snaps back to Lulu if she is too far away.</value>

  <data name="label17.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R : GLACIAL PRISON = ACTIVE: Sejuani throws an ice bola in the target direction that stops upon hitting an enemy champion, dealing magic damage and stunning them for 1 second. If the bola travels over 400 units, it becomes empowered to detonate upon reaching maximum range or hitting an enemy champion, dealing increased damage and stunning for 1.5 seconds instead. For the same duration, a frost storm is created that slows enemies within by 30% and grants sight of the area in a smaller radius. Afterwards, the storm shatters to deal magic damage to enemies hit and slow them by 80% for 1 second, as well as revealing them and granting sight of the area for 0.5 seconds.</value>

    <value>PASSIVE: FURY OF THE NORTH = INNATE - ICEBREAKER: Enemies stunned by Sejuani are marked Frozen for the disable's duration.
