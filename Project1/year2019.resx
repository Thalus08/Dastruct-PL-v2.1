    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>R : THE BOX = ACTIVE: Thresh erects a pentagon of spectral walls around him that each last for 5 seconds. A wall will break upon enemy champion contact, dealing magic damage and slowing them by 99% for 2 seconds. Enemies that break a wall cannot do so again for 1 second.

    <value>W : DEADLY PLUMAGE = ACTIVE: Xayah enters a frenzy for 4 seconds, gaining bonus attack speed and empowering her basic attacks to strike a second time, dealing 20% damage. Whenever Xayah hits an enemy champion with the strike, she gains 30% bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds. If Rakan is nearby upon cast, he also becomes empowered, and gains the bonus movement speed at the same time as Xayah.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label29.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R : FEATHERSTORM = ACTIVE: Xayah leaps into the air, becoming untargetable and ghosted for 1.5 seconds. After 1 second, she shoots 5 Feathers in a cone in the target direction that deal physical damage to enemies hit.

Kegs can be basic attacked by enemies or Gangplank (including his Parrrley), dealing 1 damage to it. When an enemy destroys it, it is safely defused. When Gangplank destroys it, it explodes and also triggers a chain reaction that explodes other nearby connected kegs with a 0.33 seconds-delay between explosions. The explosions also grant sight of their radiuses for 2 seconds. Enemies caught in an explosion are slowed for 2 seconds, and are dealt the triggering attack's damage, dealing bonus physical damage against champions.

Thresh will also mark the target Shackled for 1.5 seconds, during which he is unable to declare basic attacks, and is slowed by 20% for 1 second. While the target is stunned, Thresh tugs twice over 0.8 seconds, pulling the target a short distance with each tug. After 0.5 seconds of hitting an enemy or instantly after hitting a minion or monster, Thresh can recast the ability while the target is Shackled, which will cause him to stop tugging.
