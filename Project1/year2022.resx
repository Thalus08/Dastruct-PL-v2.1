    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>R : ONSLAUGHT OF SHADOWS = ACTIVE: Hecarim dashes with displacement immunity to the target location and summons 5 spectral riders in an arrow formation that charge alongside him in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies in their path and revealing them for 2.5 seconds. Upon arrival, he fears nearby enemies for 0.75 − 1.5 (based on distance traveled) seconds and slows them, ramping to 99% over the duration. The wave of spectral riders travels independently of Hecarim and will always charge at the same distance. The slow's strength cannot be reduced and is increased based on how far away the affected units are from Hecarim. Onslaught of Shadows will cast at max range if cast beyond that.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label16.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>W : SPIRIT OF DREAD = ACTIVE: Hecarim surrounds himself with the Spirit of Dread for 4 seconds, dealing magic damage every second to nearby enemies. While active, Hecarim gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance and is healed for 25% (+ 2% of 100 bonus AD) of the post-mitigation damage dealt to enemies within the area, halved to 12.5% (+ 1% of 100 bonus AD) for damage dealt by allies. The healing is capped against minions and monsters.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label15.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>E : DEVASTATING CHARGE = ACTIVE: Hecarim becomes ghosted and gains 25% − 65% (based on time active) bonus total movement speed for 4 seconds. During this time, Hecarim empowers his next basic attack to gain 50 − 250 (based on distance traveled) bonus range and cause him to dash in the target's direction, revealing them for 1 second. If the target remains nearby during the dash, the ghosting and bonus movement speed ends prematurely and Hecarim knocks them back 150 − 350 (based on distance traveled) units, though not through terrain, stuns them for 0.25 seconds, and deals them modified physical damage, increased by 0% − 100% (based on distance traveled). Devastating Charge can critically strike for (75% + 35% 35%) AD bonus physical damage. Devastating Charge resets Hecarim's basic attack timer. Hecarim can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Devastating Charge's duration is paused during Onslaught of Shadows Onslaught of Shadows.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label14.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Q : RAMPAGE = ACTIVE: Hecarim cleaves his glaive around himself, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies, reduced to 60% against minions. If this damages an enemy, Hecarim gains a stack of Rampage for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent damage and stacking up to 3 times. Each stack increases Rampage's damage by 4% (+ 5% per 100 bonus AD) and reduces its base cooldown by 0.75 seconds, up to a 12% (+ 15% per 100 bonus AD) damage increase and a 2.25-second reduction of the base cooldown at maximum stacks. Stacks expire by one every 1 second when the duration ends.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label31.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R : TEMPERED FATE = ACTIVE: Bard sends magical energy arcing to the target location, granting sight of the area during travel. Upon impact, it puts all units within into stasis for 2.5 seconds, as well as stunning all enemy, minions, and turrets struck for the same duration. Enemies hit are revealed for the duration. Epic monsters and turrets are affected by Tempered Fate despite being immune to crowd control.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label30.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>PASSIVE: HEADSHOT = INNATE: Caitlyn's basic attacks generate a stack of Count on-attack, doubled when attacking from brush. At 6 stacks, or 5 while in brush, her next basic attack consumes all stacks to become a Headshot. HEADSHOT: Caitlyn's basic attack is empowered to have an uncancellable windup and deal (60 / 90 / 120% (based on level) + (131.25% + 26.25% 26.25%) critical strike chance) AD bonus physical damage, increased to (110 / 115 / 120% (based on level) + (131.25% + 26.25% 26.25%) critical strike chance) AD against non-champions. Enemies that step over a Yordle Snap Trap or are hit by 90 Caliber Net can grant an additional Headshot against them at 1300 range within 1.8 seconds, without consuming stacks. Each method grants only one Headshot at a time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label29.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Q : PILTOVER PEACEMAKER = ACTIVE: Caitlyn fires a piercing shot in the target direction that deals physical damage to the first enemy it passes through, after which it expands in width but deals only 50% damage to enemies it hits thereafter. Enemies revealed by Yordle Snap Trap always take full damage from Piltover Peacemaker.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label24.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>W : YORDLE SNAP TRAP = ACTIVE: Caitlyn sets a visible trap at the target location that is untargetable and arms after 1 second, lasting for a duration. The trap grants sight of the area for 1 second after being placed. Caitlyn periodically stocks a Yordle Snap Trap charge, up to a maximum amount. Deploying traps beyond the maximum destroys the oldest one. The next enemy champion that springs the trap is rooted for 1.5 seconds, revealed for 3 seconds, takes additional damage from Headshot, and becomes immune to further Yordle Snap Traps for 3 seconds.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label41.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>E : 90 CALIBER NET = ACTIVE: Caitlyn fires a net in the target direction and recoils 390 units in the opposite direction. The net deals magic damage to the first enemy hit and slows them by 50% for 1 second. Caitlyn will not dash backwards if she is immobilized or grounded during the cast time. She can cast any of her abilities during the dash.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label25.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R : ACE IN THE HOLE = ACTIVE: Caitlyn locks onto the target enemy champion and channels for 1 second, revealing them as well as revealing herself. Once Caitlyn completes the channel, she fires a homing bullet toward the target that deals physical damage to the first enemy champion it hits, increased by 0% − 25% (based on critical strike chance).</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label37.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>W : CARETAKER'S SHRINE = ACTIVE: Bard conjures a shrine at the target location that gathers power over 10 seconds, granting sight of its surroundings for 1.8 seconds. Shrines last until they are consumed by champions moving over them. Up to 3 shrines may be active at a time. If the champion was an ally or Bard himself, they are healed for an amount based on the shrine's power and gain 30% bonus movement speed that decays over 1.5 seconds.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label36.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>E : MAGICAL JOURNEY = ACTIVE: Bard opens a one-way magical corridor through a piece of terrain in the target direction for 10 seconds. A champion can pass through the corridor by selecting it, becoming revealed during the travel. Bard and allies travel through the portal at 33% increased speed. A nearby valid piece of terrain is required to cast this ability. Magical Journey cannot be taken while immobilized or grounded.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label23.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R : WORLD ENDER = ACTIVE: Aatrox unleashes his true form for 10 seconds, fearing nearby enemy minions and monsters for 3 seconds, during which they are gradually slowed by up to 99% over the duration. He also gains ghosting and bonus movement speed that decays by 10% of the current bonus every 0.25 seconds, lasting until World Ender has ended. Whenever Aatrox scores a champion takedown, he extends the duration by 5 seconds and becomes unleashed again. During World Ender, Aatrox gains bonus attack damage and 5% increased size, and receives increased self-healing from all sources.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label22.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>E : UMBRAL DASH = PASSIVE: Aatrox heals for a portion of the persistent post-mitigation damage he deals against enemy champions, increased during World Ender. ACTIVE: Aatrox dashes in the target direction. Umbral Dash resets Aatrox's basic attack timer and can be cast during his other abilities without cancelling them and vice versa.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label21.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>W : INFERNAL CHAINS = ACTIVE: Aatrox sends a chain in the target direction that deals physical damage to the first enemy hit, doubled against minions, and slowing them by 25% for 1.5 seconds. If this hits an enemy champion or large monster, a tether is formed between the target and the ground beneath them for 1.5 seconds, during which they are revealed. If the tether is not broken by the end of its duration, the target is dealt the same physical damage again and pulled to the center of the area.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label18.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Q : THE DARKIN BLADE = ACTIVE: Aatrox can activate The Darkin Blade three times before the ability goes on cooldown, with a 1 second static cooldown between casts. If Aatrox does not recast the ability within 4 seconds of the previous cast, it goes on cooldown. Aatrox performs a strike with his greatsword for each of the three casts, dealing physical damage to enemies hit within an area. Enemies hit within a Sweetspot of the area take 60% bonus damage and also knocked up for 0.25 seconds. Each subsequent cast increases The Darkin Blade's damage by 25%. FIRST CAST: Aatrox's first strike affects a 625 × 180-unit rectangular area in the target direction, with him centered on the back line and the Sweetspot at the farthest edge. SECOND CAST: Aatrox's second strike affects a trapezoidal area in the target direction, with the Sweetspot at the farthest edge. The hitbox begins 100-units behind Aatrox and extends 475-units in front of him, measuring between 300 and 500-units wide from behind to in front. THIRD CAST: Aatrox's third strike affects a 300-radius circular area centered on a target location that is 200 units in front of him, with a 180-radius Sweetspot within.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label19.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>PASSIVE: DEATHBRINGER STANCE = INNATE: Periodically, Aatrox empowers his next basic attack to gain 50 bonus range and deal bonus physical damage equal to 5% − 12% (based on level) of the target's maximum health, capped at 100 against monsters. Aatrox Heal power icon.png heals for 80% of the post-mitigation bonus damage dealt, reduced to 25% against minions. Whenever Aatrox hits at least one enemy champion or large monster with a basic attack on-hit or an ability, the cooldown of Deathbringer Stance is reduced by 2 seconds, modified to 4 if he hits with the Sweetspot of The Darkin Blade.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label35.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>PASSIVE: TRAVELER'S CALL = INNATE - ANCIENT CHIMES: Bard's presence causes sacred Traveler's Call Chimes to appear at random locations on the map, lingering for up to 10 minutes. Collecting a Chime grants Bard 24% bonus movement speed out of combat for 7 seconds, stacking up to 5 times, with every other Chime collected beyond the first granting an additional 14% bonus movement speed, up to a total of 80% bonus movement speed, 20 + (1 per minute after 5 minutes) experience, and 12% maximum mana. Bard empowers his Meeps each time he collects 5 Chimes. INNATE - MEEPS: Bard's presence attracts Meeps, which are small spirits that come to his side. While he has Meeps, his basic attacks are empowered to each consume a Meep on-attack to deal 35 (+ 14 per 5 Chimes collected) (+ 30% AP) bonus magic damage. At 5 Chimes, Meeps slow damaged enemies by 25% − 75% (based on number of Chimes) for 1 second. At 15 Chimes, Meeps deal the damage to enemies within 150 units of the primary target as well as those in a cone behind them. At 35 Chimes, the cone's radius increases. Meeps spawn every 8 − 4 (based on number of Chimes) seconds and Bard can have up to 1 − 9 (based on number of Chimes) of them at a time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label34.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Q : COSMIC BINDING = ACTIVE: Bard fires an energy bolt in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy hit and slows them by 60% for a duration. After Cosmic Binding hits an enemy, the bolt continues behind them for 300 units. If the bolt hits terrain or a second enemy, it stuns both targets for the same duration, dealing the same damage to the secondary target.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label9.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R : EMPEROR'S DIVIDE = ACTIVE: Azir calls forth a phalanx of soldiers from 175 units behind him, catching enemies from up to 325 units behind him and charging forward 575 units in the target direction. Enemies impacted by the charge are dealt magic damage and knocked away over 1 second to a line 650 units in front of Azir. Upon finishing their charge, the soldiers stand as a wall for 5 seconds, acting as impassible terrain against enemies and granting sight of their surroundings. Azir and his allies can move through these soldiers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label8.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>W : ARISE! = PASSIVE: Azir gains bonus attack speed, doubled for 5 seconds if he summons a third concurrent soldier. ACTIVE: Azir summons a Sand Soldier at the target location that is untargetable, lasts 10 seconds, and grants sight of its surroundings. The Sand Soldier expires twice as fast while within range of an enemy turret, and does so instantly if Azir is too far away. Azir periodically stocks a Sand Soldier, up to a maximum of 2. When Azir declares a basic attack against an enemy in a soldier's attack range, the Sand Soldier attacks in his stead, dealing 50 − 150 (based on level) (+ 55% AP) magic damage to enemies struck in a line. Targets beyond the closest take 25 / 50 / 75 / 100% (based on level) damage. Subsequent Sand Soldiers beyond the first deal 25% damage. Sand Soldiers cannot attack structures, wards, nor traps.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label7.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>E : SHIFTING SANDS = ACTIVE: Azir grants himself a shield for 1.5 seconds and dashes to the target Sand Soldier, dealing magic damage to enemies he passes through. If Azir dashes into an enemy champion, he stops and gains a charge of Arise! Arise!. Azir can cast of any of his abilities during the dash.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label6.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Q : CONQUERING SANDS = ACTIVE: Azir orders all Sand Soldiers to dash toward the target location, dealing magic damage to all enemies they pass through and slowing them by 25% for 1 second. Enemies hit by subsequent soldiers are instead slowed by an additional 25% per soldier. Conquering Sands will cast at max range if cast beyond that.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label13.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>PASSIVE: SHURIMA'S LEGACY = INNATE: Whenever a turret outside the enemy team's base is destroyed, a marker is placed above its ruins which can be targeted by Azir. INNATE - DISC OF THE SUN: Azir can select a marker to construct the Sun Disc above the ruins after a 0.5-second cast time. The Sun Disc will activate after being assembled over 5 seconds. The Sun Disc functions the same as a standard inner turret, gains 15% AP bonus attack damage, and grants its kill credit to Azir. The Sun Disc's health decays over 60 seconds and loses 100 armor while Azir is not alive or is too far away. Azir cannot construct a Sun Disc with the marker while he is unable to cast abilities.</value>
