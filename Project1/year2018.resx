    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>PASSIVE: SECOND SKIN = INNATE - LIVING WEAPON: Kai'Sa can evolve each of her basic abilities by gaining a set amount of permanent stats from items and stat growth, granting them additional effects. Evolving an ability causes her to enter a 2-second cast time. The upgrade is lost if the stat requirement is no longer met. INNATE - PLASMA: Kai'Sa's basic attacks on-hit and Void Seeker apply stacks of Plasma to enemies for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 5 times. Basic attacks each apply 1 stack and Void Seeker applies 2 stacks, increased to 3 if it is evolved. Her and nearby allies' immobilizing effects and polymorphs against enemy champions will also apply a stack of Plasma. INNATE - CAUSTIC WOUNDS: Plasma stacks applied by Kai'Sa's basic attacks or Void Seeker deal 5 − 23 (based on level) (+ 1 − 12 (based on level) per Plasma stack before application) (+ 15% − 25% (based on Plasma stacks before application) AP) bonus magic damage. The fifth stack against a target consumes them all to deal additional bonus magic damage equal to 15% (+ 6% per 100 AP) of the target's missing health, capped at 400 against monsters.</value>

  <data name="label25.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Q : ICATHIAN RAIN = ACTIVE: Kai'Sa releases a swarm of 6 missiles that evenly distributes among nearby visible enemies, each one hitting their target after 0.4 seconds to deal physical damage. Minions below 35% health take double damage. EVOLUTION: Requires「 Attack damage icon.png 100 − 66 (based on level) attack damage from items 」to upgrade – Icathian Rain instead fires 12 missiles.</value>

  <data name="label34.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>PASSIVE: FEY FEATHERS = INNATE: Periodically, Rakan grants himself a shield for 30 − 225 (based on level) (+ 95% AP) that lasts until broken. After being out of combat for 5 seconds, any leftover shield will be restored to maximum value. Rakan's basic attacks and ability hits reduce Fey Feathers' cooldown by 1 second for each enemy champion hit. INNATE - LOVER'S LEAP: If either Rakan or Xayah is channeling Recall, the other may move nearby and channel their own to join alongside them. Both reach base at the time of which the initiator's Recall completes.</value>

    <value>R : HERO'S ENTRANCE = ACTIVE: Galio prepares to make an entrance, channeling for 2.75 seconds and designating the target allied champion's location at the time of cast as his landing spot. Additionally, he resets Shield of Durand's Shield of Durand's passive shield for himself and grants it to all allied champions within the area for 5 seconds. After channeling for 1.25 seconds, he gains crowd control immunity for the remaining duration, becomes untargetable, and leaps into the air for 0.85 seconds before dashing to his destination over 0.25 seconds. Afterwards, he lands and becomes targetable again, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies upon impact, knocking them back 100 units over 0.75 seconds, and remaining in place for 0.4 seconds.</value>

  <data name="label31.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>R : THE QUICKNESS = ACTIVE: Rakan breaks into a captivating sprint for 4 seconds, gaining ghosting and 75% bonus movement speed for the duration. During this time, he deals magic damage to enemies he collides with and charms and slows them by 75% for a duration. This cannot affect the same enemy more than once.
